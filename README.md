# Pi4GPU - Raspberry Pi CM4 GPU Carrier Board

_a.k.a. 'PiG'_

This project contains the code and designs for a carrier board intended to unite a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 to any manufacturer's GPU.

The board is not exclusively intended for GPU testing, thoughâ€”this project is helpful for testing any kind of full-size PCI Express card with a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 or any CM4-compatible System on Modules (SoM).

## Goals

This project includes all the design files to build the Pi4GPU project:

  - **CM4 carrier board** (with PCIe x4 edge connection)
    - 1x full-size HDMI (rear)
    - 1x RJ45 Ethernet (rear)
    - 2x USB 2.0 (rear)
    - 1x 12v barrel power plug (rear)
    - 1x microSD card slot for Lite CM4 (top)
    - 4-pin PWM fan header with EMC2301 fan controller for optional fan (possibly)
  - **PCIe adapter board**
    - 1x x4 (x1 signaling) PCI Express slot for CM4 carrier board
    - 1x x16 (x1 signaling) PCI Express slot for GPU or other device
  - **3D printed stand**
    - Stable base for the Carrier board, extends to support 3+ slot GPUs
    - Mounting points for PCIe card brackets (in the future)

## Current Status

Early prototype. It works, but there are plenty of improvements to be made! Check out the issues for current work and future improvements.
